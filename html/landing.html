            Rather than focusing solely on protecting the natural environment, we should strive to create a world where the environment doesn't need protection. Biotechnology is seen as a potential solution to achieving this goal. The proposed prototype includes three sub-topics: bioplastics, biofuel from algae, and bio constructional raw materials.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="fs-4">
            <span class="fw-bolder text-decoration-underline">Bioplastics</span> are a type of plastic made from renewable resources such as corn starch, sugarcane, and potato starch, rather than non-renewable resources like petroleum. Bioplastics can be composted, which reduces the environmental impact of plastic waste. They also have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions because they are made from renewable resources.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="fs-4">
            <span class="fw-bolder text-decoration-underline">Biofuel from algae:</span> Biofuels are renewable fuels made from living organisms. Algae can be used to produce biofuels because they grow quickly and can be cultivated in large quantities. Algae biofuels have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on non-renewable fossil fuels.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="fs-4">
            <span class="fw-bolder text-decoration-underline">Bio constructional raw materials:</span> Construction materials made from renewable resources such as bamboo, straw, and hemp are considered bio constructional raw materials. These materials have the potential to reduce the environmental impact of construction by using renewable resources and reducing waste.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="fs-4 fw-bold">
            Overall, the proposed prototype suggests that biotechnology can be used to create sustainable solutions in various sectors, including plastics, energy, and construction. However, it is important to note that while biotechnology can offer benefits, it is not a panacea and should be used alongside other sustainable practices to create a truly sustainable world.

          <h2>Bio-Plastics</h2>
          <p class="fs-4 fw-bold">
            Bioplastics are a type of plastic that is made from renewable, bio-based resources such as corn starch, agar, glycerin, cassava starch, and potato starch. Unlike traditional plastics, which are derived from non-renewable fossil fuels, bioplastics are made from natural resources and can be biodegraded, composted, or recycled, reducing their environmental impact. Bioplastics are an eco-friendly alternative to traditional plastics, which take centuries to degrade and can harm the environment by polluting waterways and harming wildlife.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="fs-4 fw-bold">
            The use of bioplastics in various applications has several advantages. For one, they can be used to replace traditional plastics in a wide range of applications, from packaging materials to single-use utensils, reducing our dependence on non-renewable fossil fuels. Bioplastics can be engineered to have a range of physical and chemical properties, making them suitable for various applications.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="fs-4">
            Corn starch, for example, can be used to produce a type of bioplastic called polylactic acid (PLA), which is commonly used in packaging and disposable products. Glycerin can be used to produce a type of bioplastic called polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), which can be used in medical implants and other applications.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="fs-4">
            Cassava starch, which is abundant in tropical regions, can be used to produce bioplastics that are highly durable and water-resistant, making them suitable for use in food packaging and other applications where water resistance is important.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="fs-4 fw-bold">
            Another advantage of bioplastics is that they can be biodegraded, composted, or recycled, reducing their impact on the environment. Biodegradable bioplastics, for example, can be broken down by microorganisms into natural compounds such as carbon dioxide, water, and organic matter, reducing their impact on the environment. Compostable bioplastics, on the other hand, can be composted along with food waste, reducing the amount of waste sent to landfills.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="fs-4 fw-bold">
            In conclusion, bioplastics are a promising alternative to traditional plastics, offering several advantages such as being made from renewable resources, having a range of physical and chemical properties, and being biodegradable, compostable, or recyclable. While bioplastics are not a panacea, they have the potential to reduce our dependence on non-renewable fossil fuels and contribute to a more sustainable future.

            Biofuels are renewable fuels that are derived from biological materials such as crops, waste, and algae. Algae are a promising source of biofuels due to their high productivity, fast growth rate, and ability to grow in a wide range of conditions. The production of biofuels from algae involves extracting oil from the algae and converting it into biodiesel through a process called transesterification.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="fs-4">
            The transesterification process involves several steps. First, the algae are harvested and dried to remove excess water. The dried algae are then processed to extract the oil, which is typically done using a solvent such as hexane. Hexane is a hydrocarbon solvent that is used to extract the oil from the algae, leaving behind a solid residue.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="fs-4">
            Once the oil has been extracted, it is mixed with alcohol and a catalyst such as caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) to produce biodiesel. The alcohol used in the transesterification process is typically methanol or ethanol, and an excess of methanol is used to force the reaction. The catalyst helps to break down the oil into its component parts, which can then be reassembled into the fatty acid methyl esters that make up the biodiesel.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="fs-4">
            During the transesterification process, the alcohol and catalyst are mixed with the algae oil and heated to around 60-70 degrees Celsius. The mixture is then stirred for several hours to ensure that the reaction is complete. Once the reaction is complete, the mixture is allowed to settle, with the biodiesel rising to the top and the glycerin and other byproducts settling to the bottom. The biodiesel is then separated from the glycerin and other byproducts, and can be used as a fuel.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="fs-4 fw-bold">
            In conclusion, the production of biodiesel from algae involves several steps, including the extraction of oil from the algae and the transesterification of the oil into biodiesel. The use of hexane and caustic soda as solvents and catalysts respectively helps to facilitate the transesterification process, which produces biodiesel that can be used as a renewable fuel source.

          <h2>Bio-Constructional Materials</h2>
          <p class="fs-4 fw-bold">
            Air pollution is a major problem in many parts of the world, with the emissions from industries and vehicles being major contributors. The construction industry is also a significant contributor to air pollution, with the production of traditional building materials such as bricks and tiles contributing to carbon emissions. To address this problem, we have developed a solution in the form of bio constructional raw materials made from carbon emissions.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="fs-4">
            Our solution involves collecting carbon emissions from industries and vehicles and using them to create innovative and sustainable building materials. The collected carbon is processed and transformed into carbon tiles, carbon bricks, and carbon rooftop tiles, which can be used in construction projects. These materials are made by combining carbon particles with binders, and then pressing them into various shapes and sizes.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="fs-4">
            The use of carbon emissions to create building materials has several benefits. First, it helps to reduce the amount of carbon emissions in the atmosphere, which contributes to improving air quality and protecting people from health issues related to air pollution. Second, it provides a sustainable alternative to traditional building materials, which are often made from non-renewable resources and contribute to environmental degradation.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="fs-4">
            The bio constructional raw materials we have developed are also reusable and renewable. This means that they can be recycled and used again in other construction projects, further reducing the amount of waste generated by the construction industry. Additionally, the use of renewable materials helps to reduce the environmental impact of the construction industry and contributes to building a more sustainable future.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="fs-4 fw-bold">
            In conclusion, our bio constructional raw materials made from carbon emissions are an innovative and sustainable solution to the problem of air pollution and traditional building materials. They have the potential to significantly reduce carbon emissions and improve air quality, while also providing a sustainable alternative to traditional building materials.
